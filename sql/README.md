# SQL

The [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)
might as well be called the "Standard Query Language"
becuase it is nearly synonymous with databases.
While there are many variations on SQL
we mostly care about two gold-standard open source implementations:
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) and
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org).
